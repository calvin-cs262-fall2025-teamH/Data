# Sample Data Service

This repository contains a sample PostgreSQL database designed for learning, testing, and demonstration purposes. It includes:

- **Database schema**: Multiple tables with relationships.
- **Example data**: Sample records to populate the tables.
- **Example queries**: Common queries demonstrating how to access and manipulate the data.

The SQL scripts are located in the `SQL/` directory and can be directly executed in a PostgreSQL environment.

## Purpose

This project can be used to:

- Explore PostgreSQL features and query writing.
- Serve as a reference for building simple data services.
- Test applications that interact with a PostgreSQL database.
